**Assignment Title: Multimodal Interaction System Using Touch, Voice, and Gesture**

---

**Objective:**
To develop a web-based system that integrates multiple interaction modalities such as touch, voice, and gesture to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. This system enhances user accessibility and usability by allowing interactions through various natural input methods.

---

**Requirements:**

1. **Software Requirements:**
   - A modern web browser (preferably Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge)
   - Text Editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)
   - Internet connection (to access external JS libraries)

2. **Libraries and Tools:**
   - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
   - Web Speech API (for voice recognition)
   - Handtrack.js (for gesture detection)

3. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - Computer or laptop with built-in or external webcam
   - Microphone (built-in or external)

**Working of the Project:**

The system comprises three types of interactions:

1. **Touch Interaction:**
   - Users can click on the on-screen buttons to trigger UI changes.
   - Example: A button changes the background color and displays an alert message upon clicking.

2. **Voice Interaction:**
   - Utilizes the Web Speech API to listen for specific voice commands.
   - Recognizes words like "blue" or "green" and changes the background color accordingly.
   - If an unrecognized command is given, the system notifies the user.

3. **Gesture Interaction:**
   - Uses the handtrack.js library to detect the presence of a hand via webcam.
   - When a hand is detected, the interface changes (e.g., background color updates).
   - Real-time detection is shown through text output on the page.

The system runs entirely on the client side within a web browser. Camera and microphone permissions must be granted for the gesture and voice features to work.

**Procedure:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Create an HTML file that includes structure for buttons and video elements.
   - Add styling with CSS to center content and allow a background video.
   - Include JavaScript to handle events and feature integrations.

2. **Integrating Touch Events:**
   - Add an `onclick` handler to a button element that changes the page background and shows a message.

3. **Voice Recognition Setup:**
   - Initialize the Web Speech API in JavaScript.
   - Add functionality to capture spoken input and trigger actions.

4. **Gesture Detection Setup:**
   - Load the handtrack.js model with required parameters.
   - Start video stream from webcam.
   - Continuously detect hand presence and update the interface.

5. **Testing:**
   - Open the webpage in a compatible browser (Edge recommended).
   - Ensure permissions for microphone and camera are allowed.
   - Interact using buttons, voice, and hand gestures to test each modality.

---

**Advantages and Applications:**
- Offers an intuitive and accessible interface.
- Can be used in smart homes, education, and assistive technology.
- Adds user engagement through dynamic and responsive interactions.

---

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates how multimodal interaction can significantly enhance web usability. By incorporating touch, voice, and gesture controls, the interface becomes more natural and user-friendly. The implementation can be extended to include more complex commands, multi-user environments, and mobile compatibility.
